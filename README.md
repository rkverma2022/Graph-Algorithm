Graph Algorithm 

**A. Graph Representation** 
1. Adjacency Matrix

      Space Complexity = O(n^2)


2. Adjacency List
   

      Space Complexity for undirected = 2 * E

   
      Space Complexity for directed = E


**B. Graph Traversal**

1. BFS

         visit the 0 - level, --> 1 - level --> 2 - level ...
2. DFS
